## Act 1: Redhaven

Redhaven is a rough-and-ready mining town with just enough prosperity to attract attention, and just enough fear to keep tempers sharp. The players will arrive here before heading to Emberkeep, and what they learn/choose here will shape how Act 2 begins.

Atmosphere: Smoke from the forges, miners coated in soot, a marketplace that smells of roasted meat and hot iron. The Emberkeep ruin looms over all conversations, casting both literal and figurative shadow.


### NPCs

#### Mayor Elira Stoneward (LN, dwarf)

- Goal: Protect the town and its people. Wants the Emberkeep sealed, no matter the cost.
- Personality: Stern, pragmatic, distrustful of outsiders.
- Secret: Knows the miners have been hiding strange “flame crystals” from the undercrypts.
- Hook: Will pay the adventurers to investigate and report back, but she insists on secrecy.
- Checks: Persuasion DC 13 (to win her trust), Insight DC 15 (to notice she’s hiding something).

#### Brother Kaelen (NG, human priest of Lathander)

- Goal: Believes the Emberkeep can be cleansed, not destroyed. Wants to save what history remains.
- Personality: Passionate, kind, slightly reckless.
- Secret: He’s been sneaking into the ruins to pray at the old chapel and has seen elemental spirits.
- Hook: May join the party as a guide or plead with them to spare the keep’s relics.
- Checks: Religion DC 12 (to understand his visions), Persuasion DC 14 (to recruit him as a guide).

#### Captain Sera Blackthorn (CN, human mercenary leader)

- Goal: She and her crew want to loot the Emberkeep. Sees the adventurers as rivals or allies.
- Personality: Brash, pragmatic, mercenary loyalty.
- Secret: She’s already lost two scouts in the ruins — but won’t admit it unless pressured.
- Hook: Offers to team up or split territory, but will double-cross if given a chance.
- Checks: Intimidation DC 15 (to make her reveal the missing scouts), Insight DC 13 (to sense her lie).


### Rumors in Town (Players can gather info in taverns, markets, temples - pick whichever check is most relevant)

- DC 10 Persuasion: “The miners dug too deep. They say the stones in Emberkeep glow red like coals now.”
- DC 12 Insight: A miner speaking of “treasure” is hiding fear — it’s more curse than fortune.
- DC 14 History: Emberkeep was destroyed in a firestorm 40 years ago. Witnesses claimed it was “unnatural flame.”
- DC 15 Arcana: A mage recalls tales of elemental rifts — unstable tears to the Plane of Fire.


### Possible Encounters (Choose or improvise based on pacing)

#### Bar Brawl at the Emberflame Inn

- A miner, drunk and raving about “fire demons,” picks a fight.  
- Checks: Strength (Athletics) DC 12 to restrain, Persuasion DC 13 to calm, Intimidation DC 14 to end it.  
- Failure escalates into a tavern-wide brawl (nonlethal).

#### The Burning House

- On the way to the town centre, a warehouse suddenly bursts into flames.  
- Checks: Athletics DC 12 (rescue), Acrobatics DC 13 (navigate collapsing beams), Arcana DC 14 (recognize elemental magic).  
- Clues (fissures in the ground) lead toward Emberkeep.

#### Mercenary Challenge
- If the adventurers walk in any quiet areas of town, or bad neighbours they get approached by mercenaries that take them to a hideout. 
- Captain Sera’s mercs might provoke the adventurers into a duel to “prove their worth.”  
- Can be settled by combat (nonlethal duel, 1v1), gambling (Deception DC 15), or drinking contest (Constitution DC 12).


### Decision Point: How Do They Approach Emberkeep?

The way the party handles Redhaven determines their entry to Act 2:

1. Work with the Mayor → Stealth mission to seal the crypt. (She supplies maps, healing potions, +1 escort.)

2. Side with Brother Kaelen → Quest to recover relics from the chapel. (He provides healing, holy water, lore.)

3. Team with Captain Sera → Aggressive raid, loot-focused. (Her mercs join but may betray mid-dungeon.)

4. Go Alone → Players make their own path, but with fewer resources.
