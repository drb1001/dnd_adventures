# Ashes of the Emberkeep

This adventure should last 4-6 hours and be for 3-5 players of level 3.

### Summary
The players arrive in the frontier town of Redhaven, built in the shadow of the ruined Emberkeep Fortress, which was destroyed in a mysterious fire decades ago. 

Recently, miners in the surrounding hills have uncovered a forgotten tunnel leading into the keep’s undercrypts. Strange fires and disappearances plague the town, hinting that the Emberkeep’s destruction was no accident: a sealed elemental rift within its depths has begun to flare open again. 

The adventurers must investigate, facing townsfolk politics, rival treasure hunters, and fiery elemental corruption. The choices the party makes — whether to negotiate with townsfolk, ally with rivals, or strike straight into the ruins — will shape Redhaven’s fate. 

Ultimately, they’ll confront a Flame-touched Warden (CR ~4 boss, customizable) guarding the unstable rift. The players’ decisions determine whether they seal the rift, exploit it for power, or unleash it upon the world.

This adventure has 3 acts:
- Redhaven (Roleplay, Investigation, Politics)
- The Emberkeep Undercrypts (Exploration, Traps, Combat)
- The Rift’s Heart (Moral Choice & Boss Battle)
