## Act 2: The Emberkeep Undercrypts

### Background

The Emberkeep undercrypts are a mix of ancient dwarven stonework, collapsed fire-blackened halls, and newly unearthed mining tunnels. The place feels alive with heat — faint flickers of flame dance in cracks, whispers of elemental fire stir the shadows.

The players descend through a collapsed mining shaft into the keep’s crypt entrance. The dungeon has 3 primary segments, each with multiple approaches, skill check opportunities, and encounters:
  1. The Ruined Antechamber
  2. The Hall of Ash and Bone 
  3. The Inner Sanctum


### Entering the Emberkeep

> The air grows hotter with every step toward Emberkeep. The path winds through jagged cliffs and blackened stone, where the earth itself seems scorched by some long-forgotten fire. The wind carries a faint metallic tang, like heated iron. Ahead, the remains of a mining rig cling to the cliffside — ropes and pulleys descending into a gaping shaft that breathes warm air from below. The faint glow of embers flickers in the darkness beneath, pulsing like a heartbeat. As you lower yourselves down the shaft, the world above fades — replaced by the deep, muffled hum of fire sleeping beneath stone.


### Inside Emberkeep

**DM: use the battle map**


#### 1. The Ruined Antechamber

> Your boots crunch on shattered stone as you lower yourselves into the ruined antechamber. The air is thick with soot and silence. Charred statues of dwarven kings stand like sentinels, their faces melted into grim masks. Faded mosaics glimmer beneath ash, and ahead, a great cracked iron gate hangs cracked and blackened by flame.

Description: Rubble-strewn chamber with charred statues of dwarven kings and soot-blackened mosaics depicting Emberkeep in its prime. A cracked iron gate blocks the way forward.

Interactions:
  - Force the Gate (Athletics DC 14) → Noisy, draws an early patrol encounter.
  - Search for Hidden Passage (Investigation DC 15) → Finds a concealed side door leading to the same corridor but bypasses patrol.
  - Arcane Approach (Arcana DC 12) → Recognize a weakened ward on the gate; a spell like Dispel Magic or clever use of Thaumaturgy can open it quietly.
  - Searching rubble (Investigation DC 15) uncovers a melted silver relic (25 gp).

Encounter: If noisy → 2 Ember-Touched Scouts patrol in and attack
  - 2x Ember-Touched Scouts (use Thug stat block)
    - HP 32, AC 11, Pack Tactics, Melee (Mace) attacks have +1d4 fire damage
    - They fight to the death
  - Aftermath: when they are defeated, they melt into ash, nothing left behind. 


#### 2. The Hall of Ash and Bone

> 

Description: A long hall with collapsed pillars. Ash covers the floor in drifts. Skeletons of long-dead soldiers lie half-buried. The air shimmers with heat.

- Trap/Challenge: Ash conceals smoldering fissures that erupt when stepped on.
   - Detection: Perception DC 13 to spot faint glowing cracks.
   - Avoidance: Acrobatics DC 14 to leap across safely (if seen)
   - Failure: DEX save DC 16 (if not seen) or 2d6 fire damage.

- Twist: Disturbing the skeletons awakens Ash-Bound Dead
   - 3-4x Ash-bound dead (use Skeleton stat block)
     - HP 13, AC 13
   - Aftermath: One skeleton clutches a rusted but enchanted shortsword (+1 Shortsword, faint fire glow).

  
> At the hall’s end lies a massive dwarven seal, cracked and glowing faintly with firelight from below. The heat is oppressive. Runes flicker in broken patterns.  

- The Elemental Seal:
   - Arcana DC 15 → Determine it’s a fire elemental ward, weakened but still suppressing.
   - Strength DC 16 → Break through physically, but results in an elemental backlash (1d8 fire damage to all in the room).
   - Ritual Repair → A skill challenge: Religion DC 13 + Arcana DC 13 (2 successes before 2 failures). Failure → triggers a fire elemental attack.
   - Encounter: on failing ritual repair, or forcing the seal (succeed or fail), a fire elemental appears: 
      - Small Fire Elemental (use Azer stat block, with warhammer reskinned as a "fire punch")
        - HP 39, AC 17


#### 3. The Inner Sanctum

> 

Description: A desecrated chapel of Emberkeep. Pews are scorched, an altar cracked down the middle, walls lined with melted dwarven carvings. A rift pulses at the far end, flickering with unstable flame.
The Warden stands behind the Altar, with his back to the door. 

**DM: for added tension, you can wait until the whole party has entered, and slam a door behind them before the Warden speaks**


Warden taunts intruders, offering choice: “Serve the Flame, and I grant you its power — resist, and be ash.”


Interactions:
   - Search pews: Investigation DC 12 → Find a healing potion hidden by past refugees.
   - Altar: Religion DC 15 → Sense it once held a relic of Lathander; shattered fragments hum faintly with residual light.
   - Parley with the Warden (Deception/Intimidation/Persuasion DC 16). Success → possible temporary alliance.

   - Rift energy makes spellcasting unstable (any spell level 1–3 has a 10% chance of fire backlash for 1d6 damage).
   - Use relic fragments (Religion DC 15 or Arcana DC 17) → weaken the Warden (reduce HP by 25%).

   - Encounter: The Flame-Touched Warden (CR 4–5, reskinned Knight/Flame-wreathed creature) guards the rift.
     - Fight (full boss encounter).




### End of Act 2 Transition

After the Warden is dealt with, the players must decide how to handle the rift:

- Seal it (Mayor’s path) – Ritual skill challenge closes it. Redhaven is saved.

- Cleanse it (Kaelen’s path) – Purify altar & rift; relics preserved. Fire elemental energy becomes dormant.

- Exploit it (Captain Sera’s path) – Harness the energy; gain fiery artifacts, but risk long-term instability.

This decision drives Act 3: The Rift’s Heart and Consequences.
