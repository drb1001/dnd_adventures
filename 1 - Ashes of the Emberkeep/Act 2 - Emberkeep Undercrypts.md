## Act 2: The Emberkeep Undercrypts

The Emberkeep undercrypts are a mix of ancient dwarven stonework, collapsed fire-blackened halls, and newly unearthed mining tunnels. The place feels alive with heat — faint flickers of flame dance in cracks, whispers of elemental fire stir the shadows.

The players descend through a collapsed mining shaft into the keep’s crypt entrance. The dungeon has 3 primary segments, each with multiple approaches, skill check opportunities, and encounters.

### Dungeon Flow

1. The Ruined Antechamber

Description: Rubble-strewn chamber with charred statues of dwarven kings and soot-blackened mosaics depicting Emberkeep in its prime. A cracked iron gate blocks the way forward.

Choices:

Force the Gate (Athletics DC 14) → Noisy, draws an early patrol encounter.

Search for Hidden Passage (Investigation DC 15) → Finds a concealed side door leading to the same corridor but bypasses patrol.

Arcane Approach (Arcana DC 12) → Recognize a weakened ward on the gate; a spell like Dispel Magic or clever use of Thaumaturgy can open it quietly.

Encounter: If noisy → 2 Ember-Touched Scouts (reskinned bandits with fire damage) patrol in.

Treasure: Searching rubble uncovers a scorched silver holy symbol (25 gp).

2. The Hall of Ash and Bone

Description: A long hall with collapsed pillars. Ash covers the floor in drifts. Skeletons of long-dead soldiers lie half-buried. The air shimmers with heat.

Trap/Challenge: Ash conceals smoldering fissures that erupt when stepped on.

Detection: Perception DC 13 to spot faint glowing cracks.

Avoidance: Acrobatics DC 14 to leap across safely.

Failure: 2d6 fire damage from sudden eruption.

Twist: Disturbing the skeletons awakens Ash-Bound Dead (reskinned skeletons with a 1d4 fire aura on hit).

Choice Point:

Fight through the undead.

Religion DC 14 → Lay the dead to rest, avoiding combat.

Stealth DC 15 → Bypass without disturbing remains.

Treasure: One skeleton clutches a rusted but enchanted shortsword (+1 Shortsword, faint fire glow).

3. The Elemental Seal (Midpoint)

Description: At the hall’s end lies a massive dwarven seal, cracked and glowing faintly with firelight from below. The heat is oppressive. Runes flicker in broken patterns.

Choices:

Arcana DC 15 → Determine it’s a fire elemental ward, weakened but still suppressing.

Strength DC 16 → Break through physically, but risk elemental backlash (1d8 fire damage to all).

Ritual Repair → A skill challenge: Religion DC 13 + Arcana DC 13 (2 successes before 2 failures). Failure → triggers a fire elemental attack.

Encounter (on failure or forcing the seal): Small Fire Elemental (CR 2) emerges, testing party’s resource use.

4. The Inner Sanctum

Description: A desecrated chapel of Emberkeep. Pews are scorched, an altar cracked down the middle, walls lined with melted dwarven carvings. A rift glow pulses at the far end, flickering with unstable flame.

Choices:

Search pews: Investigation DC 12 → Find healing potions hidden by past refugees.

Altar: Religion DC 15 → Sense it once held a relic of Lathander; shattered fragments hum faintly with residual light.

Rift energy makes spellcasting unstable (any spell level 1–3 has a 10% chance of fire backlash for 1d6 damage).

Encounter: The Flame-Touched Warden (CR 4–5, reskinned Knight/Flame-wreathed creature) guards the rift.

Warden taunts intruders, offering choice: “Serve the Flame, and I grant you its power — resist, and be ash.”

Players may:

Parley with the Warden (Deception/Intimidation/Persuasion DC 16). Success → possible temporary alliance.

Fight (full boss encounter).

Use relic fragments (Religion DC 15 or Arcana DC 17) → weaken the Warden (reduce HP by 25%).

### End of Act 2 Transition

After the Warden is dealt with, the players must decide how to handle the rift:

Seal it (Mayor’s path) – Ritual skill challenge closes it. Redhaven is saved.

Cleanse it (Kaelen’s path) – Purify altar & rift; relics preserved. Fire elemental energy becomes dormant.

Exploit it (Captain Sera’s path) – Harness the energy; gain fiery artifacts, but risk long-term instability.

This decision drives Act 3: The Rift’s Heart and Consequences.
