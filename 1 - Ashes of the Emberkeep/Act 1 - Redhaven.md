## Act 1: Redhaven

### Background

Redhaven is a rough-and-ready mining town with just enough prosperity to attract attention, and just enough fear to keep tempers sharp. The players will arrive here before heading to Emberkeep, and what they learn/choose here will shape how Act 2 begins.

Atmosphere: Smoke from the forges, miners coated in soot, a marketplace that smells of roasted meat and hot iron. The Emberkeep ruin looms over all conversations, casting both literal and figurative shadow.

**DM: decide why the players have arrived in Redhaven.**   
Here are some ideas, but feel free to use your own: 

1. Mayor Elira Stoneward has quietly sent for adventurers to investigate recent fires and disappearances around Emberkeep. The mayor promises gold and favor — but also places responsibility squarely on the party’s shoulders: if they leave, the town may burn.
2. Your party has heard rumors of miners that have uncovered a vein of ember-crystals — glowing red gems warm to the touch, priceless and dangerous. You know that there will be many that want to get their hands on them, so you need to be quick! 
3. One of the magic users in the party feels a uneasy pull towards Redhaven — dreams of burning light, whispers of an elemental presence calling them. The pull strengthens each night; leaving feels impossible until the source is confronted.
4. One of the PCs has a history with Redhaven — perhaps their mentor died in Emberkeep’s fall, their family hails from the town, or they were once part of the dwarven garrison stationed there. As they return, old wounds reopen; redemption, closure, or vengeance keeps them tied to the crumbling walls.

### Exploring the Town 

**DM: encourage the players to explore the town**

> As you settle into Redhaven, it’s clear something isn’t right. The townsfolk are jumpy, keeping their voices low whenever the old Emberkeep ruins are mentioned. A few buildings show scorch marks that look… too fresh. You overhear talk of miners gone missing, and of strange lights near the cliffs at night. The mayor’s guards eye you with suspicion, but others seem relieved to see armed travelers. If you want to learn what’s really happening here, you’ll need to talk to the locals — the mayor, the temple priest, the mercenaries at the tavern. Everyone knows something — they’re just too afraid to say it aloud.

Players can gather info in taverns, markets, temples - pick whichever check is most relevant or interesting.  

Suggested checks when chatting to random locals - they are only allowed one attempt for each check: 
- DC 10 Persuasion: “The miners dug too deep. They say the stones in Emberkeep glow red like coals now.”
- DC 12 Insight: A miner speaking of “treasure” is hiding fear — it’s more curse than fortune.
- DC 14 History: Emberkeep was destroyed in a firestorm 40 years ago. Witnesses claimed it was “unnatural flame.”
- DC 15 Arcana: A mage recalls tales of elemental rifts — unstable tears to the Plane of Fire.


### Optional Encounters

#### Bar Brawl at the Emberflame Inn

> You push open the heavy oak door of the Emberflame Inn, and warmth rushes out to meet you — the smell of spiced ale, roasting meat, and smoke-stained wood. Quiet laughter mixes with the crackle of the hearth and the clatter of mugs. Yet beneath the cheer, a nervous tension hums — conversations falter when strangers enter.

- After too long in the tavern, a drunk miner, raving about “fire demons,” picks a fight:  
> - “Look at you lot — shiny weapons, clean boots. Think you’re heroes? You wouldn’t last five minutes in the Ember tunnels before you’re screamin’ like the rest of us!”
>  - “Laugh all you want! Those fires in the tunnels ain’t natural — they move! They followed us, blast it! Followed us back here! They'll get you next”  
>  - “We dug too deep... too greedy, that’s what it was. The earth’s burnin’ from the inside out, and nobody listens! Not the mayor, not the priest—no one!”  
> - “Go on then, heroes! Go play savior in the ruins! Maybe the ‘fire demons’ will roast you proper — then I’ll drink to that!”
> - “Say another word and I’ll show you what the fire did to me!” (he slams a burned hand on the table, grabs his mug, and hurls it toward the nearest adventurer)

- Checks: Strength (Athletics) DC 12 to restrain, Persuasion DC 13 to calm, Intimidation DC 14 to end it.  
- Failure in any check escalates into a tavern-wide brawl (theatre of the mind):
  1. Drunken Miner (use Bandit stat block)
        - HP 11, AC 12, Improvised weapons only. Targets the leading PC (eg the one who did the check) in drunken rage. 
  2. 3x Supporting Combatants (use Commoner stat blocks)
        - HP 4, AC 10, improvised weapons only. Defends themselves and their friends. 
  3. (Optional) 1-2x mercenaries (use Thug stat block)
        - HP 32, AC 11, Mace. Testing the PCs to see if they are worth a chat with Captain Sara.
    - Ending: If the drunken miner goes to 0HP, or after 3-4 rounds the town guards enter. 
    - Aftermath: 
        - Everyone involved gets thrown out of the tavern.
        - If the town guards come in, the PCs are "invited" to meet Mayor Elira in the market.
        - If the PCs "win" then they can have a conversation with the mercenaries to meet Captain Sara (see below).


#### The Burning House

> As you make your way through Redhaven’s narrow streets, a sudden roar splits the evening air. Flames erupt from a nearby warehouse, billowing black smoke into the sky. Townsfolk scream and scatter, buckets sloshing uselessly. The heat hits you like a hammer — and over the crackling fire, someone is still inside, shouting for help. You think you have mere seconds before the roof gives way. What do you do?”

- If the players hesitate, have the crowd cry out: “Someone help them!” to add pressure.
- If they go inside, each interaction requires a skill check:
    - Blocked Door: A fallen beam blocks the entrance. Athletics DC 12 or take 1d4 fire damage as the heat intensifies.
    - Smoke & Heat: The air is thick; breathing burns. Constitution save DC 13 each round or	Disadvantage on all checks next round.
    - Falling Debris: After each PC action, roll a d6. On a 6, a burning rafter crashes down. Dex Save DC 13 or 1d6 fire or bludgeoning damage and trapped for 1 round unless helped.
    - If any player has to turns to navigate through the building, they find the trapped worker: Athletics DC 12 to lift the beam. Acrobatics DC 12 to crawl through a narrow gap.
    - If they succeed, they escape just as the roof collapses — cinematic slow-motion moment!
- If players use clever magic (e.g. Create Water, Gust, Mage Hand, Shape Water), reward them with advantage or auto- success. 
- As they leave, describe faint fissures of glowing red light snaking along the ground near the warehouse’s foundations — like cracks in cooling lava. Arcana DC 14 or Nature DC 15 to recognize it as elemental fire energy, not mundane flame. This points them toward Emberkeep: “Whatever started this wasn’t normal fire… it’s coming from the old ruins.”
- Aftermath: 
   - If they succeed, they get advantage on persuasion checks with the Mayor "I heard of your good deads already".
   - If they ignore it or fail, they get disadvantage on persuasion checks with the Mayor "you stood by and watched".

#### Mercenary Challenge

> The streets grow quieter as you leave the bustle behind. Lanternlight fades, and only the clink of your boots echoes on the cobblestones. Suddenly, from the shadows ahead, two figures step out — armored, confident, smirking. A woman with a scar across her jaw folds her arms. “Captain Sera wants a word. But first, you need to prove your worth.”

- 1v1 non-lethal dual (If the mercenaries have taken part in the bar brawl above skip this step)  
  - PCs nominate someone from their team
  - 1x mercenary (use Thug stat block)
    - HP 32, AC 11, Mace. Testing the PCs to see if they are worth a chat with Captain Sara.
  - Ending: finish at the end of the round someone reaches 1/2 full HP. 
  - Aftermath: 
    - If PCs win, they are shown to the hideout. 
    - If the mercenaries win, they slink into the shadows. 

> You’re led through twisting alleys to a shuttered warehouse lit by torchlight. Inside, mercenaries lounge on crates, polishing weapons and watching you with amusement. At the far end, Captain Sera Blackthorn leans over a map-strewn table. She doesn’t rise as you enter — just looks up, smirks, and says, “So… you’re the newcomers. You're on my territory.”


### Decision Point: How Do They Approach Emberkeep?

**DM: encourage the party to make a decision about how they will approach Emberkeep**   

The way the party handles Redhaven determines their entry to Act 2:

1. Work with the Mayor → Stealth mission to seal the crypt for good. (She supplies maps, healing potions)
2. Side with Brother Kaelen → Quest to recover relics from the chapel. (He provides healing, holy water, lore.)
3. Team with Captain Sera → Aggressive raid, loot-focused. (Her mercs join but may betray mid-dungeon.)
4. Go Alone → Players make their own path, but with fewer resources.
