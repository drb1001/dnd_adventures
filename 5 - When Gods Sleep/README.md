The world around you feels… thin. Like the fabric of reality has been stretched taut, and somewhere far off, it’s beginning to tear. 

You stand at the edge of a silver lake that mirrors the night sky, its waters rippling not with wind but with heartbeat-like pulses. A spire of black stone juts from the lake’s center, its tip lost in rolling clouds that flash with violet lightning. A whisper brushes your ears, not in words but in emotions: sorrow, fear, longing.

As you gaze upon the spire, the shoreline crumbles away behind you. The sky folds inward, colors bleeding like wet paint. The lake draws you in—whether by choice or inevitability, you cannot say. When the cold water closes over your head, breath is stolen not from your lungs but from your very thoughts. Darkness claims you... and when your eyes open again, you are not where you were.

The ground beneath you is an endless marble hall, mirrored and distorted, stretching in impossible directions. Doors float in midair, stairways curl back upon themselves, and whispers echo: fragments of memory, prayers long forgotten, and the rattling of chains. You have entered a dream, and there may be no waking until its secrets are laid bare.
