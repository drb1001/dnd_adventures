# The Shards of Dusk

### Act 0 - DM Summary


The adventure, "The Shards of Dusk", centers on the fractured remnants of an ancient artifact, the Aegis of Dawn, once used to banish a primordial being of shadow known as Veythar, the Dusk Maw. 

Now, as the stars align and the barrier weakens, Veythar stirs. 

Unless the shards are reassembled into the Aegis, he will fully manifest at midnight during the Celestial Convergence, twelve hours from the start of the session. 

The players must race across the cursed city of Kaeltharion, a metropolis half-subsumed by shadow, recovering the five shards of the Aegis before the Convergence. Each shard recovered weakens Veythar in the final confrontation (reducing his legendary resistances, summoning fewer minions, lowering his AC, etc.). 

The catch: rival cultists, shifting alliances, and the corruptive influence of the shadows mean that choices matter  - failing a social encounter or taking too long can change where a shard lies or who possesses it.

The adventure is designed around modular objectives: players can attempt to gather all five shards, but time pressure may force them to choose. Each shard represents a distinct scene/encounter arc (combat, exploration, or social). 

The final showdown will vary in difficulty based on how many shards they recover and how they handle factional politics within the doomed city.


#### Mechanics of the countdown

- there are 12 Hours Until the Celestial Convergence
- The adventure is divided into 12 in-game hours.
- Each major action (travel, combat, exploration, social intrigue, resting) costs 1â€“3 hours depending on scope.
- You, as DM, should advance the clock after every significant decision or encounter, narrating the growing tension as dusk deepens into night.
- Tip: Use a visible Countdown Tracker so players feel the pressure of time slipping away.
