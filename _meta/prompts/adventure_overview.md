I want you to design a [one-shot] adventure for D&D 5e. The adventure should last [10-12] hours and be for [5] players at level 10. 
I will be responsible for character creation with the players and running the game (including handling the encounters, game mechanics, rules, progress tracking, etc). 
You are responsible for designing the adventure including: world building, scene setting, npc creation, designing encounters, etc. 
The story should NOT be railroaded - the players should be able to make meaningful choices that affect the story. Please give indications where important ability checks should be made, with appropriate DC values. 
You can use pre-existing D&D locations and npcs if that makes things easier. 
[Optional: I would like this adventure to be about ...]

To start with can you give me a paragraph with an overview of the adventure (this will not be shared with players, so can include spoilers) and another paragraph setting the scene (this will be shared with players at the start of the session).
