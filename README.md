## D&D adventures

This is repository of D&D adventures written by AI.  
The adventures have been edited by humans, but 90% of the content is AI generated.  


#### How to use: 

- Find an adventure in the table below.  
- Each adventure is in its own folder - look at the README.md file in the folder to get a flavour of the story (this file can be shared with players, it doesn't contain any spoilers) 
- All other files should be kept secret from players at the start of the game. 

#### Note:

1. The adventures use the mechanics of fifth edition (5e) of Dungeons & Dragons.
1. Each adventure is independent - there is little continuity or overlap, so they can be done in any order.   
1. The dungeon master may have to rescale combat encounters and quest rewards if the number or level of players is different.
1. The status column in the table gives an indication of how ready the adventure is for play.
