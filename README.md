## D&D adventures

This is repository of D&D adventures. They have been generated by AI and then improved by humans.  


#### How to use: 

> NOTE!  
> The files called README can be read by all (players and DMs) to get a flavour of what the adventure is about.  
All other files should be kept secret from players at the start of the game. 


1. The adventures use the mechanics of fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons.
1. Each adventure is independent - there is little continuity or overlap, so they can be done in any order.   
1. The dungeon master may have to rescale combat encounters and quest rewards if the number or level of players is different.
